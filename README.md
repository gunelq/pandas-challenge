Homework for Module 4-Pandas
For this homework we had a data that was using to analyze district-wide standardized test results. 
Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, we created a report that includes the following data. 

District Summary:

1. Did necessary calculations and then created a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame. Like:

T1. otal number of unique schools

2. Total students

3. Total budget

4. Average math score

5. Average reading score

6. % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

7. % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

8. % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

School Summary:

key metrics about each school.


1. School name

2. School type

3. Total students

4. Total school budget

5. Per student budget

6. Average math score

7. Average reading score

8. % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

9. % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

10. % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Sorted the schools by % Overall Passing in descending order and displayed the top 5 rows.Saved the results in a DataFrame called "top_schools".

Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Sorted the schools by % Overall Passing in ascending order and display the top 5 rows.Saved the results in a DataFrame called "bottom_schools".

Math Scores by Grade
Performed the necessary calculations to create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

Reading Scores by Grade
Created a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

Scores by School Spending
Created a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).Create four bins with reasonable cutoff values to group school spending.Used pd.cut to categorize spending based on the bins.

Used the scores above to create a DataFrame called spending_summary.

1. Average math score

2. Average reading score

3. % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

4. % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

5. % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

Created a new DataFrame called per-School_summary and type _summary
